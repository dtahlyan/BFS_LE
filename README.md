### NOTE
I am still updating this repo with the necessary content. This note will disappear when the repo is ready. While the example data to demostrate the code is not in the data folder yet, the code.py is ready and works perfectly. Feel free to clone this repo to start playing around. If you have any questions, please write to me at dtahlyan [AT] u [DOT] northwestern [DOT] EDU. 

# Breadth-First-Search Link Elimination (BFS-LE)
This repository contains python 3 implementation of the modified breadth first search link elimination algorithm using for generating route choice sets in a network. The algorithm was originally proposed by [Rieser-Schussler et al. (2013)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/18128602.2012.671383). The modified version, which generates *unique* routes instead of just routes, was proposed by me in my thesis and can be accessed [here](https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/7649/). A augmented version of my thesis is expected to be out as a paper soon co-authored with Prof. Abdul Pinjari. The pre-print of the paper can be accessed [here](https://abdulpinjari.weebly.com/uploads/9/6/7/8/9678119/tahlyan_pinjari_route_choicesets_march_2018.pdf).
